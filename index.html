            <p class = "mainText">After spending a year in France studying communication I came bak to <b>Vilnius, Lithuania</b>. I was still studying for my masters degree, so I found a job with flexible hours - as a website administrator for a small advertisment firm. Just a few guys working from someone's kitchen. It was shady and my paycheck was always late, but I was able to work from my dorm room while doing my homework at the same time, so I was not too worried about that. The main challange was that the software for uploading text and images to the website was in Russian and I don't really speak it.</p>

            <p class="mainText"> After moving to the US in 2017, I lived in <b>Iowa</b> for a year. It's not so easy to get a good job in a middle of the corn field when you have no references (at least no American references) and your specialization is French language and Communication. So I decided to do the next best thing - work at Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore in a mall. That was terrible, but at least I heard <i>&quot;Welcome to America&quot;</i> from the customers multiple times per day, because people in Iowa are nice and they don't even think that that's slightly insulting. </p>

            <h2 class= "position">Fundraising</h2>
            <p class = "mainText">After a year in Iowa I finally moved to <b>St. Louis</b>. Like everyone else in fundraising, I got into this field by accident. I work at the History Museum and help raising money to support exhibitions, collections and programs at MHS. It doesn't pay much, but at least I get to do something that I'm pasiionate about and my soul is not dying in a big corporation. But again, no money!</p>
